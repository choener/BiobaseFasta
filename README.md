# BiobaseFasta

## A Haskell library for FASTA-file handling.

The version does streaming using the 'streaming' library.

The library is, in general, in a "preview" state. In cases where you need to
scan large FASTA files fast and with low memory overhead, the functions within
should already be useable enough.

The wikipedia has information on the format:
