description:
                Enumeratees for FASTA-handling and convenience functions. In a
                typical application, the user should write an enumeratee to
                extract information to allow for efficient low-memory handling
                of queries.
                .
                Facilities for fast, efficient linear scans are provided. These
                functions are not yet stable and could move to another library,
                if more data sources require efficient scans.
                .
                The library is, in general, in a "preview" state. In cases
                where you need to scan large FASTA files fast and with low
                memory overhead, the enumeratees should, however, already be
                useable enough.
