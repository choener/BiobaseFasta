description:
                Conduit-based handling of FASTA files. This library provides a
                streaming interface. The user selects a window size, then
                handles the window. For each window, the previous (past) window
                is available, in case some data sits on the boundary between
                windows.
                .
                FastaTool is a simple tool providing information on FASTA
                files, and allowing to extract sequences and subsequences.
                .
                The library is, in general, in a "preview" state. In cases
                where you need to scan large FASTA files fast and with low
                memory overhead, the 'streamFasta' function, however, should
                already be useable enough.
